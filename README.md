### Hello World!
Hi! I'm mrnubishly and I'm very new to coding, my github profile consists of mini projects i'll work on for fun.
I mostly code with python, since I am told this is very easy and benificial to learn.
I look forward to working with the github community!
<!--
**mrnubishly/mrnubishly** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Make sure to run this code on properly with an interpreter, it probably wont work otherwise.
I dont know much about coding nor github, but i hope this is sufficient to share my code.
